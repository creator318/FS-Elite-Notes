Imagine a mystical garden with eight enchanted flower beds arranged in a straight line. In each bed, a magical blossom can either be in full bloom (represented by 1) or remain dormant (represented by 0). 

Every day, the garden performs its magic ritual: 
- The state of each blossom is updated based on the state of the two neighbouring flower beds. 
- Specifically, if both neighbours of a flower bed are either blooming or both are dormant, then the blossom in that bed will bloom the next day; 
- Otherwise, it will remain dormant. 

Note that since the garden is arranged in a single row, the first and the last flower beds have only one neighbour each and thus cannot satisfy the two-neighbour conditionâ€”they will always become dormant the next day.

You are provided with an integer array plots of length 8 where plots\[i] == 1 indicates that the blossom in the $i^{th}$ bed is blooming, and plots\[i] == 0 means it is dormant. You are also given an integer n which represents the number of days this transformation ritual takes place.

Your task is to determine the state of the garden after n days of magical transformation.

Sample Input-1:
-------------
```
0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
7
```

Sample Output-1:
-------------
```
[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Explanation: 
-------------
The garden transforms as follows over 7 days:  
  - Day 0: \[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  
  - Day 1: \[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  
  - Day 2: \[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  
  - Day 3: \[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  
  - Day 4: \[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  
  - Day 5: \[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  
  - Day 6: \[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  
  - Day 7: \[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sample Input-2:
-------------
```
1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
1000000000
```

Sample Output-2:
-------------
```
[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0] 
```

Explanation:
-------------
After one billion days of transformation, the garden settles into the final state \[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0].

Constraints:
-------------
- plots.length == 8  
- plots\[i] is either 0 or 1.  
- 1 <= n <= $10^9$

## Solution:

```java

import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    int[] arr = new int[8];
    for(int i=0; i<8; i++) arr[i] = sc.nextInt();

    int n = sc.nextInt();
    
    System.out.println(getGarden(arr,n));
    
    sc.close();
  }

  private static String getGarden(int[] arr, int n){
    int[] garden = new int[8];

    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
      for (int j=1; j<7; j++)
        garden[j] = 1 - (arr[j-1]^arr[j+1]); 
      for (int j=0; j<8; j++)
        arr[j] = garden[j];
    }
    
    return Arrays.toString(arr);
  }
}
```
